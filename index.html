          <p>There are a million nitty-gritty details that you should pay particular attention to when making the time jump. Most are subject to the specifis time you go to but the three that follow are essential in any time period: </p>
          <ol>
            <li>Don't disrupt History (<em>Changing things could make you go poof! NONEXISTENT!</em>)</li>
            <li>Blend in (<em>You wanna wear a hoodie in Ancient Rome? Might as well be wearing a noose!</em>)</li>
            <li>Avoiding meeting you past or future self (<em>Unless you fancy paradoxes, growing three noses, or finding out you died and no one remembers you.</em>)</li>
            <li>Have an escape plan (<em>Think like a thief have a way in and a way out.</em>)</li>

            <h3><u>So how exactly can you travel?üßê</u></h3>
            <p>Well, there are multiple ways that you can travel through time. Some sound realistic and others...not so much. But we are time travellers unrealistic is what we love best. Here's a list:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Time Machines- Back to the Future style</li>
              <li>Magic Spells-Doctor Strange style </li>
              <li>Accidental Time Slips-The OA style</li>
              <li>Cryogenic Freezing- The 100 style</li>
              <li>Wormholes-Interstellar style </li>
              <li>Suspiciously long naps, because why not?</li>
              <li>Or you could always get struck by lightening, become the Flash, and then run super fast.But you know there is also the change you'll just die.</li>
              <li>Even a bunch of rocks arranged in a circle work, ask Claire Fraser</li>
