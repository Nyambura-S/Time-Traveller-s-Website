            <ul>
              <li>Ancient Egypt thrived for over 3,000 years (c. 3100 BCE – 30 BCE), ruled by pharaohs, who were seen as gods on Earth.</li>
              <li>Society revolved around the Nile River, which provided water, fertile land, and trade routes.</li>
              <li>Egypt was divided into Upper and Lower Egypt, eventually unified by King Narmer around 3100 BCE.</li>
              <li>The civilization went through different periods:</li>
               <ol>
                <li>Old Kingdom (2686–2181 BCE) – Pyramid-building era.</li>
                <li>Middle Kingdom (2055–1650 BCE) – Expansion of arts, literature, and trade.</li>
                <li>New Kingdom (1550–1070 BCE) – Egypt’s most powerful period, including Hatshepsut, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, and Ramses II.</li>
              </ol>
            </ul>
             </p>
             <h2><u>Must See Landmarks.</u></h2>

              <li><strong>🔺 The Pyramids of Giza</strong> – The most iconic structures in Egypt! These massive tombs house the pharaohs of the Old Kingdom, with the Great Pyramid of Khufu standing as the tallest man-made structure for over 3,800 years.</li>
              <li><strong>🗿 The Great Sphinx</strong> – A mysterious guardian with the body of a lion and the head of a king. Nobody knows exactly why it was built, but many believe it represents Pharaoh Khafre.</li>
              <li><strong>🏛 The Temples of Karnak and Luxor</strong> – These sprawling temple complexes in Thebes are dedicated to the gods, especially Amun-Ra. Expect towering columns, massive statues, and intricate hieroglyphs.</li>
